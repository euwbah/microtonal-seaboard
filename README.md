# Microtonal Seaboard Mapper

## Quick Start

1. Connect your Seaboard RISE/Block, turn it on.
2. Check ROLI Dashboard/Equator/VST for current pitch bend range setting
3. Create a [Virtual MIDI Port](https://dialogaudio.com/modulationprocessor/guides/virtual_midi/virtual_midi_setup.php).
   Name it whatever you like.
4. Start the seaboard mapping program
5. Select the microtonal mapping to use
   - You can set it to open a mapping by default by creating/renaming 
     a mapping file to `default.sbmap` in the `mappings/` directory
6. Select the Seaboard MIDI input device
7. Select the virtual MIDI port you created as the output device.
8. Use the virtual MIDI port as the MIDI controller for your DAW/VST/Equator.
   (Check if you're accidentally using both the seaboard and virtual port at
   the same time.)
